# Simple E-Commerce App

A new Flutter project.
This is a simple e-commerce app built with Flutter. The app allows users to browse a list of items, add them to the cart, and remove them as needed. It utilizes the **Provider** package for state management in a straightforward and minimalistic way.

## Getting Started
## Features
- View a list of available items.
- Add items to the cart.
- Remove items from the cart.
- Responsive and simple UI.

## State Management
The app uses **Provider** for managing the state, particularly for tracking the items in the cart. Provider simplifies the state handling across different parts of the app.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
